Here's the current user flow — it's a 4-step wizard:

Step 1 — Phone Number
Enter your phone number (no OTP needed, just saves it to the database).

Step 2 — Language
Choose your preferred language: English, Telugu, or Hindi.

Step 3 — Upload Photos
Upload 1-3 photos of the affected crop.

Step 4 — AI Chat
This is the main screen where everything happens:

An AI avatar greets you and starts a conversation
It naturally asks about your crop name and location through chat
Behind the scenes, it extracts that info and runs a disease diagnosis API automatically
It shares the diagnosis results conversationally
It asks if you'd like a 7-day treatment plan
You pick which language you want the plan in (can be different from chat language)
A PDF is generated on the server, uploaded to cloud storage, and shown as a WhatsApp-style preview in the chat
You can also start a voice call using the mic button for hands-free conversation
Is there something about the flow you'd like to change or improve?

keep things same as before but what else is that

select language in the first place and then the entire website shall be changed to that regional language.

Flow of Solution
From opening the app to getting your personalized treatment plan — here's how KhetSaathi works in 7 simple steps.

1
Farmer Opens App / Kiosk
The farmer launches KhetSaathi on their smartphone or visits the village kiosk to get started.

2
Language Selection (AI Avatar Greets)
The farmer selects their preferred language or dialect. An AI avatar greets them and guides the process.

3
Location Detection (Auto / GPS)
The system automatically detects the farmer's location using GPS, or uses the kiosk's default location for region-specific advice.

4
Capture 1–6 Images
The farmer takes clear photos of affected leaves or crops from different angles for accurate diagnosis.

5
AI Avatar Analysis + Voice Interaction
The AI analyzes the images using advanced computer vision models and interacts with the farmer through voice for better understanding.

6
Integrated Diagnosis & 7-Day Action Plan
KhetSaathi scans the crops and delivers a personalized 7-day treatment plan in the farmer's own language.

7
Follow-Up Reminder & History Tracking
The farmer receives follow-up reminders and can track their crop health history over time for better outcomes.

Got it — you want to revamp the flow to match this 7-step design. Here's what I understand as the key changes:

Language selection moves to Step 1 — and the entire app UI switches to that language (not just the chat)
AI avatar greets in the selected language right after language selection
Location detection via GPS (auto-detect) instead of asking through chat
Upload 1-6 images (increased from 1-3)
AI avatar analysis + voice interaction — the AI analyzes images and talks to the farmer via voice
Integrated diagnosis & 7-day plan delivered in farmer's language
Follow-up reminders & history tracking — new feature for tracking past cases
Let me break down what needs to change from the current app:

Language first: Move language selection to Step 1, translate all UI text (buttons, headers, labels) into Hindi/Telugu/English
Phone number: Moves to Step 2 (or could be combined)
GPS location: Add auto-detection so the AI doesn't need to ask for location in chat
6 images max instead of 3
History tracking page: New page showing past diagnoses and plans
Follow-up reminders: New feature (would need notification mechanism — maybe WhatsApp or in-app)
A couple of quick questions before I write up the plan:

For the phone number step — should it come after language selection (Step 2), or should we skip phone entry entirely and just use the app without login?

Phone number after language (Step 2)
For follow-up reminders (Step 7) — how should reminders be sent?

Just show history in-app (no push notifications for now)
