Here are the mandatory questions a specialist should ask:1. Scope and Distribution"How much of the field is affected?"Knowing if the problem is isolated to one corner or spread uniformly helps distinguish between soil-borne issues, wind-blown spores, or localized drainage problems."Is the damage only on the fruit, or do you see spots on the leaves and stems as well?"Anthracnose often affects foliage before fruit. If the leaves are clean but the fruit is damaged, it might point to a different physiological disorder or a specific pest.2. Environmental Conditions"What has the weather been like for the past 7–10 days?"Fungal pathogens thrive in high humidity and warm temperatures (typically 24°C to 30°C). Recent heavy rains or overhead irrigation are major triggers for lesion development."What is your irrigation method and schedule?"Overhead sprinkling splashes spores from the soil onto the fruit. Knowing the timing (e.g., watering in the evening) can confirm if the fruit is staying wet long enough for fungi to germinate.3. Crop History and Management"What was grown in this field last season?"Many pathogens survive in crop debris. If the farmer planted a similar crop (like peppers or tomatoes) last year, the inoculum level in the soil is likely high."Have you applied any fertilizers or pesticides recently?"Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to infection. Additionally, knowing previous "cures" helps the doctor avoid prescribing a chemical the pathogen might already be resistant to.4. Variety and Seed Source"What specific variety/hybrid are you growing, and where did the seeds/seedlings come from?"Some varieties are bred for resistance. If a "resistant" variety is failing, it suggests a new strain of disease or a different problem entirely. Poorly sourced seeds can also be the primary source of the infection.Comparison of Healthy vs. Infected TissueQuestion CategoryPurposeTemporalTo see if the disease is progressing slowly or "exploding" across the field.CulturalTo identify if farming practices (like weeding or spacing) are contributing to the spread.NutritionalTo rule out calcium deficiencies (like Blossom End Rot) which can look similar to early lesions.
